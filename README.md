These IRI’s will most likely also work in the future. Til now they worked well and I don’t see any reason why they should change the syntax. And even if they chance something, I can just adjust my code (which of course will take some time)

Linked Data:

Linked Data is the connection of raw data to make sense out of it. Raw Data for example is a birth date, a name or eye color.
Linked Data "connects" that data to make a context, so I can create a somewhat profile from that raw Data given in the beginning.
